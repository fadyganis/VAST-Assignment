<p>
This page will list the credit card and loyalty card owners as well as the likelihood level of the employee owning that card. The level is defined as:
</p>
<p>
0 = Cannot give any confidence of identifying a specific employee as an owner of a card
</p>
<p>
1 = Positional data or time data may not be in-sync, could be person was in the vicinity or at the exact place but outside of the time window by a few minutes without anyone else being a possible answer. 
</p>
<p>
2 = Cross-check of transaction data and positional data shows person was the only possible person to use this card at that time

</p>
<p>
For a level 0, reasons may arise which makes it unable to pinpoint who owns the card for sure. An additional column is added to explain the reason.
</p>

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ownership <- read.csv("cardowners.csv")
